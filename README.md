# IBM Space X Capstone Project

## Motivation:
Over the past couple years, companies like SpaceX, Virgin Galactic, and Blue Origin have invested heavily in pioneering the commercial space age. Although Commercial Space Travel is a relatively new industry, there is already fierce competition amongst the aforementioned companies.
This competition has sparked innovation in order to provide the most affordable space flight. SpaceX, the oldest company in the space, has created a way to reuse the first stage of the rocket. The First Stage of the rocket is the biggest and most expensive part of the rocket. Simply stated, it is a booster that helps the rocket escape the atmosphere. SpaceX had developed the technology to land and retrive the first stage.
However, this first stage can be lost due to malfunction or based on mission paramaters. As such, if we can predict whether or not the first stage lands, we can predict the cost of the launch.
